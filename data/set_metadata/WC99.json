However, the majority of his deck was dedicated to board control with Cursed Scrolls, Powder Kegs, and Phyrexian Plaguelords.",

The 19-year-old Köln, Germany native played a red-artifact deck that contained more than 30 artifacts. He used those artifacts to quickly generate huge amounts of mana, with which he could play a big creature like Masticore or Covetous Dragon. He would then finish off his opponent with a well-timed Wildfire.",
