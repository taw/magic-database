This twenty-year-old native of São Paulo, Brazil, has been widely regarded as one of the best players in South America. His deck tried to stay alive long enough to play Upheaval, while floating mana to replay Psychatog on the same turn.",

The deck used blue not for countermagic, but for cards like Careful Study and Mental Note, which help the deck reach threshold more quickly, and for Wonder in the graveyard, which allows the deck's pumped-up threshold creatures to fly.",
