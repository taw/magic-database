Quick guide:

* `CachedPage` - fetches a singe page with compression and caching. Semantically equivalent to `open-uri` plus external proxy program.
* `GathererXXXPage` - various classes to extract information about single page, whatever that is.
* `Gatherer` - actual API for getting Gatherer data
* `ReservedList` - data class to check if card is on reserved list.

Everything in bin/ is just manual test script.
